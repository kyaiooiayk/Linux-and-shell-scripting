# Linux and shell scripting cheatsheet
There are 4 sections:
  - Others
  - Apple MacBookPro specific
  - Linux commands
  - Shell scripting

## Others
**Nomenclature**
- **Shell scripting** is a program that can be run on UNIX shell
- **Bash** is a Unix shell and command language

**#! bin/bash**
- Inside a bash file you need to write this line `#! /bin/bash` so the interpreter knows it is a bash file. 
- To know where your bash is use `which bash` 

## Apple MacBookPro specific

**How to install Brew**:
- [If you have sudo rights](https://brew.sh/): `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- [If you do NOT have sudo rights](https://superuser.com/questions/619498/can-i-install-homebrew-without-sudo-privileges)

**How to install htop**
- To install run [Ref](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/install-htop-on-macos-unix-desktop-running-macbook-pro/): `brew install htop`

**How to add paths to $PATH**
- Let's assume we want to add this path: `/opt/bin` to the `$PATH`: `export PATH=$PATH:~/opt/bin`
- To inspect what paths use: `echo $PATH`


## Linux commands

**chmod**
- Give a bash file (*sh.) persmission to be run 
- `>> chmod +x filename.sh`

**Curl**
- The curl command transfers data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). 
- It is designed to work without user interaction, so it is ideal for use in a shell script. 
- The software offers proxy support, user authentication, FTP uploading, HTTP posting, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume, metalink, and other features. 
- `curl [options] [URL...]`
[Ref](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/curl.htm) 

**echo**
- Print text on console
- `>>echo "Hello world!"`

**history**
- Print the last 1,000 command line history 
- `>>history`
- Search in the command history for command lines that contain the word `docker` 
- `>>history | grep docker`

**which and type**
- `which` shows the full path of (shell) commands. Its output is different based on different systems. [Ref](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/476951/what-differences-between-type-cd-and-which-cd-commands-in-linux/476955)
```
$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
```
- `type` display information about command type on Linux. We have 4 command types:
  - Built-in Shell Commands
  - Shell Functions
  - Command Alias
  - excutable Programs 
```
$ which  cd
cd is a shell builtin
cd is /usr/bin/cd
cd is /bin/cd
```

**Folders**
- List only directories: `>>!ls -d */`
- List all files in a folder in a long list format: `>>ls -l`

**touch**
- The touch command is a standard command used in UNIX/Linux operating system which is used to create, change and modify timestamps of a file. Basically, there are two different commands to create a file in the Linux system which is as follows:
  - `cat` command: it is used to create the file with content.
  - `touch` command: it is used to create a file without any content. The file created using touch command is empty. This command can be used when the user doesnâ€™t have data to store at the time of file creation.

## Shell scripting
**Conditionals**
- To use conditional we start with `if` and to end we use reverse of that condition i.e `fi`. 
- Some other commands are: 
  - `-eq` : To check if two number are equal 
  - `-ne` : To check if two number are not equal 
  - `-gt` : To check if num1 is greater than num2 
  - `-lt` : To check if num1 is less than num2 
  - `-le` : For less than equal to 
 - Let us assume we have a file names `if_example.sh` containing this:
```
#! /bin/bash

NAME="XYZ"
if [ $NAME=="XYZ" ]
then
    echo "Name is XYZ"
else
    echo "Name is not XYZ"
fi
```
 - Let us assume we have a file named `if_else_example.sh` containing this:
 ```
#! /bin/bash

NUM1=1
NUM2=2
if [ $NUM1 -eq $NUM2 ]
then
    echo "$NUM1 is equal to $NUM2"
elif [ $NUM1 -lt $NUM2 ]
then
    echo "$NUM1 is less than $NUM2"
else
    echo echo "$NUM1 is greater than $NUM2"
fi
```

**Functions**
- `$` is used to place the function arguments. 
- Let us assume we have a file named `function_example.sh` containing this:
```
#! /bin/bash

function hello()
{
    echo "hello $1 and $2"
}
hello "xyz" "abc"
```

**Loops**
- Use an alias to take the value of an iterable. 
- `do` is used for operations 
- `done` is used of the loop 
- Let us assume we have a file named `loop_example.sh` containing this:
```
#! /bin/bash

NAMES="Brad Peter John"
for NAME in $NAMES
    do
        echo "hello $NAME"
done
```

**User inputs**
- How to ask for input to the user.
- How to store those inputs. 
- How to print them on console. 
- Let us assume we have a file named `user_input_example.sh` containing this:
```
#! /bin/bash

echo  "Ente two numbers:"
read num1 num2
echo "You entered:  $num1 and $num2"
```

**Variables**
- It is a convection to write variables in **uppercase** letter. Please also see two ways of printing the output. Let us assume we have a file named `variable_example.sh` containing this:
```
#! /bin/bash

VALUE = "10"
echo "$VALUE"
#or
echo "${VALUE}"
```
